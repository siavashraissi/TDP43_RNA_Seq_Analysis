# TDP43_RNA_Seq_Analysis
A differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data from TDP-43 positive/negative cells, a gene commonly implicated in FTD-ALS pathologies.

TDP-43-writeup.pdf: a full paper describing the introduction, methods, and results visualized. 
realproject.rmd: contains the entire DESeq workflow, commented. Includes visualizations produced and explains each step and decision made in the analysis.
output: a folder containing all files from DAVID/KEGG/GO annotating upregulated, downregulated, and all genes; filtered DESeq results as Excel files.
input: a folder containing the RNA-seq count data and sample metadata as provided by Ma, et al.
DESeq2Report: a folder with the html files generated by the regionReport package, summarizing visualizations and statistical tests on the final DESeq results.
